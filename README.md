# Football-Player-Segmentation-Using-Ensemble-Clustering-Fuzzy-C-Means-and-K-Modes
Create segmentation of mixed data using ensemble clustering. The data is about statistics of top 5 european football player in 2020/2021 season. I created cluster with fuzzy c-means and k-modes algorithm.
The goal of the project is to get segmented football player based on player performance that can use to improve the team or being reference for next strategical and transfer window.
The segmentation using fuzzy c-means algorithm for numerical data and k-modes algorithm for cathegorical data, then using k-modes algorithm for mixed data.
